According to one of the famous beliefs, the origin of Basant Panchami festival lies in Aryan period. Aryans came and settled in India, crossing Saraswati River. There was lot of development at that time around the banks of Saraswati River. Hence, Saraswati River began to be associated with fertility and knowledge, and locals began to celebrate this festival. According to another mythology, Kalidasa married to beautiful princess through trickery. The princess once kicked him out of her bed after she learned that he was foolish. After this incident, Kalidasa decided to commit suicide. Goddess Saraswati emerged from the waters and asked him to take a dip in the Saraswati River. After taking dip in the river, Kalidasa became knowledgeable and started writing poetry. From then Basant Panchami is celebrated to adore Goddess Saraswati, the goddess of education and learning.

Basant Panchami is celebrated every year in the Magh month of Hindu calendar. It is celebrated on the fifth day of the Magh month which generally falls on February/March of Gregorian calendar. During ancient days, Basant Panchami was celebrated in the royal palace of Kamadeva. West Bengal celebrates this festival as Saraswati Puja, Punjab and Bihar as festival of kites. It is celebrated in Nepal also.

Although the festival is dominated by the worshipping of goddess Saraswati, a grand feast is prepared to honor Kamadeva as well. It is auspicious to host weddings during the festival. On this day many toddlers start their education. Yellow color has a great significance in the celebration of Basant Panchami. It is the symbol of blossoming flowers of mustard. Hence goddess Saraswati followers wear yellow attire and prepare sweets which are yellow and saffron in color. Statues of Saraswati are decorated with yellow sari and jewellery in most of the educational institution and worshipped. In West Bengal, colorful processions are held to carry Saraswati idols and immerse it in the holy river Ganga. In Punjab, the festival is celebrated by flying colorful kites.

Holi Holi is a festival of colors. This festival is a message of the arrival of spring. Upon its arrival, all beings and even nature are pleasers and are uprooted. Hindus celebrate Phalgun month with great pomp every year. This festival is a symbol of union and sacred love. This festival is celebrated with great joy and gaiety by the peasants and the days are ready by harvesting the crops grown by the farmers throughout the year. They do not fail to see their crop waving. House farmers sing together and dance. On this day all the people in the night fire the new grain in the fire of Holi and distribute its grains to everyone and forget Aapasabarma and hug each other. In the evening, women and children worship Holi.

A story related to Holi is very popular. Prahlada, son of Daityaraja Hiranyakashipu, was the ultimate devotee of God. But father Hiranyakashipu was an atheist. The father forbade the son to take the name of God many times but did not consider Prahlad. The father gave many kinds of torture to the son. Even tried to kill him, but Prahlada, a devotee of God, did not deviate from his path.

In the end Hiranyakashipu set him on the lap of his sister Holika and set him on fire. Holika had the boon that she could not burn in the fire, but the result was reversed. Holika was burnt to ashes while Prahlada's hair was not tied. Hence Holi is considered a symbol of the victory of religion over unrighteousness. And since then Holi is lit at night in memory of this incident.
The next day of Holi is of the bride. On this day, Holi is played with color and gulaal till about two in the afternoon. Children, young and old men and women participate in this Holi.

Baisakhi festival celebration in PunjabBaisakhi festival celebration in Punjab 
Baisakhi is the Sikh New Year's Day as it is not just a Spring-time harvest festival but also a day that is commemorative of the formation of the Khalsa Panth of warriors under Guru Gobind Singh in 1699.

Every year it is celebrated on 13 April and after every 36 years, on 14th April.

The word Baisakhi comes from the Hindu calendar month of Vaishakh. It is the second month in the Hindu calendar that begins with the month of Chaitra and ends with Falgun or Fagun. This is the time when the farmers in the northern part of India have harvested the season's crops and are gearing up for the next season's sowing.

On this day. Gurdwaras wear a festive look as they gear up to welcome the footfall of thousands of devotees. Sikhs take a holy dip in nearby ponds or lakes and don festive gears. Nagar kirtan processions are carried out, food-charity or Langar Seva is held. 

Nagar Kirtan is the procession of Guru Granth Sahib - the holy book of Sikhs. This religious procession is carried out by devotees chanting or singing holy hymns. The procession is always led by the Panj Pyare (the five beloved ones who form the central part of the Khalsa), dressed in saffron. They are followed by the holy book of the Sikhs, Guru Granth Sahib, and other members of the procession. Sewadars or volunteers help clear beforehand the road through which the procession is to pass. The procession arrives finally at the designated Gurudwara where Ardas or the prayer is offered.

For the non-Sikh Hindus too, it is a holy day. A number of people mark it as a day to take a dip in a river or lake and then visit a temple, It is a day of making and sharing sweetmeats and dance and festivity.

Incidentally, Baisakhi - in its own local flavour, is observed in Bengal, Assam (Rongali Bihu) and Bihar too.

    The Bihus are the national festivals of Assam. There are three such festivals in Assam: in the months of Bohaag (Baisakh, the middle of April), Maagh (the middle of January), and Kaati (Kartik, the middle of October). The Bihus have been celebrated in Assam from ancient times. Each Bihu coincides with a distinctive phase in the farming calendar. The Bohaag Bihu marks the New Year at the advent of seeding time, the Kaati Bihu marks the completion of sowing and transplanting of paddies, and the Maagh Bihu marks the end of the harvesting period. Bohaag Bihu is also called the Rongaali Bihu or the Festival of Merriment, Maagh Bihu is also called Bhogaali Bihu or the Festival of Food, Kaati Bihu is also called Kongaali Bihu or the Festival of the Poor.
Of the three Bihu festivals which are secular and non-religious, the Bohaag Bihu ushers in the period of greatest enjoyment and marks the arrival of Spring. The folk songs associated with the Bohaag Bihu are called Bihugeets or Bihu songs. The Bohaag Bihu lasts for several days during which "the young people in the vilalge may be seen moving about in groups gaily dressed or forming circles in the midst of which the prettiest girls dance" (The History of Human Marriage by Edward Western-March) singing songs of love and romance. Such gatherings are called Mukoli Bihus (Open Bihus). The songs are very popular among all sections of the people.

The language of the Bihu songs have changed from generation to generation. The songs are composed in couplets that rhyme (and are almost always accompanied by a distinctive form of dancing), and each couplet depicts a different emotion. The language is simple and suggestive, and the style is neat and clear. Scholars agree that the songs have no influence of Sanskrit, the ancient language of religious text and learned commentaries.

The Bihu songs have exercised great influence on Assamese literature. Even the translator (Madhav Deva, 1849-1596 AD) of the great Hindu epic Ramayana and the great hymn composer Sankar Deva (1449-1569 AD) could not escape their influence.

At the current time, Mukoli Bihus are not common any more. In towns and cities, there are well-organized Bihu fairs where professional or amateur troupes perform Bihu songs on stage with accompanying dancing. Bihu Kunwori (The Princess of the Bihu) contests are held widely. In these contests, young women compete in dancing to the tune of Bihu songs. The best dancer is given the title of Bihu Kunwori.

            Thrissur Pooram Known as the festival of festivals, Thrissur Pooram has a tradition of more than 200 years. This spectacular event was started by Sakthan Thampuran, the erstwhile ruler of Kochi. Held on the Moolam asterism in the Malayalam month of Medam (April-May), festival related events take place at the Vadakkumnathan temple situated in the heart of   Thrissur town and the adjoining Thekkinkadu ground.

The pooram festival mainly happens between two groups representing the geographic divisions of Paramekkavu and Thiruvambadi. They will compete in their respective presentations of richly caparisoned elephants, traditional orchestra called panchavadyam, the swift and rhythmic changing of brightly coloured and sequined parasols called kudamattom and the dazzling fireworks in the early morning hours are the festival highlights.


The procession taking the representation of the Goddess of Thiruvambadi to Brahmaswam Mutt; arrival of the procession to the mutt accompanied by panchavadyam called madathil varavu; the pooram setout of Paramekkavu temple by noon and the one-hour long chembada melam (melam means orchestra); Ilanjithara melam (orchestra held in front of the Ilanji tree); Thekkotirakkam ; meeting of the two temple groups of Thiruvambadi and Paramekkavu; Kudamattom (exchange of colourful parasols), the small-scale fireworks; the panchavadyam (traditional temple orchestra) at night; the major fireworks at early morning; the pakal pooram held on the next day; the fireworks following it and finally the conclusion of pooram festivities with the ceremonial departure called upacharam cholli piriyal are the main events of the pooram festival.    

The goddesses of Thiruvambadi and Paramekkavu are believed to be taking part in the pooram. Though the presiding deity at Thiruvambadi is Lord Krishna, it is the second in importance deity of Goddess Bhagavati that takes part in the pooram. There are also eight other temples taking part, but some exclusive rights as part of pooram are vested with Paramekkavu and Thiruvambadi temples. Those rights include rights on the path surrounding the Vadakkumnathan temple and also fireworks and exchange of parasols.   

The festivities on the main day commence with the arrival of poorams from eight temples. By 6.30 in the morning, the first pooram of Kanimangalam Sastha temple will arrives at the Vadakkumnathan temple, followed by others like Karamukku Bhagavathy, Choorakattukavu Bhagavathy, Naithilakattu Bhagavathy, Laloor Bhagavathy, Panayckambilli Sastha, Ayanthol Karthiyayani Bhagavathy, and Chembookavu Bhagavathy.

            Janmashtami is celebrated with all fervor and heightened spirits throughout the country. It marks the birth anniversary of Lord Krishna who is believed to be an incarnation of Vishnu as per Hindu religion.

            The festival celebration takes place on the eight day of the dark fortnight of the month of Shravana (August-September) as per Hindu calendar. Krishna was the eighth son of Devaki and Vasudeva. King Kansa ruled the Yadava province “Mathura” and a prophecy predicted the death of the king by the eight sons born to his sister. Kansa killed all the six children given birth by Devaki after imprisoning the couple. The seventh one, Balarama was secretly handed over to Rohini. The eighth child was Krishna. Vasudeva escaped from the prison the night Krishna was born and he was handed over to his foster parents, Yasoda and Nanda in Gokula.
            
            The incarnation of Krishna marks the end of darkness and rooting out of the evil forces dominating the earth. It is said that he was a true Brahmin who had reached Nirvana. Krishna is known to be blue in color where blue like the sky marks the infinite potential and power of the Lord. His yellow clothes represent the color of earth when introduced into a colorless flame. A pure, infinite consciousness was born as Krishna to eliminate the evil and revive the goodness.
             The enchanting music of the flute played by Krishna is symbolic of divinity. The grown Krishna later returned to Mathura where he killed Kansa and put an end to his evil deeds.
            
            Hindus celebrate the festival of Janmashtami over two days at temples, homes and community centers. A fast is kept by the devotees 24 hrs prior to celebration that begins at the midnight. The occasion is marked by placing a statue of the deity in the cradle and bathing it in panchamrit made up from milk, ghee, honey, gangajal and tulsi leaves. This panchamrit is distributed as prasad to the devotees.
            
            Often a procession of a baby placed and rocked in a cradle is carried through the crowd. Chanting of Kirtans, Aartis , reciting verses and presenting flowers is a common sight in the temples and other places where worship is going on. Decoration and the waving lights that cover the temples is a marvelous scene in the night.
            
            Mumbai has its own tradition of celebrating Janmashtami by organizing Matki Phodo’(meaning –break the earthen pot) contests where group comprising of young boys and girls participate to form a ring, forming one floor over the other to reach the matki filled with curd hanging on a heightened string. The group of devotees that is able to break the pot first overcoming the falls and rising again to form the floors of ring structure is declared the winner. Such contests are organized in various localities.
            
             Lord Krishna’s birth and life had a profound impact on Indian culture, philosophy and civilization. The role played by Krishna in Bhagwat Gita describing the epic war called Mahabharata involves a dialogue between Krishna and Prince Arjuna where Krishna as a teacher and divine charioteer presents: dharma, yoga, karma, jnana and bhakti as the essential elements of warrior behavior.
            
            Gita’s preaching of disciplined actions without any attachment to the outcome is the fundamental principle taught in Bhagwat Gita.

All the festivals celebrated in India have their own specialties. Many of these festivals are associated with the virtuous memory of avatar men. Vijayadashami is also a sacred festival. This festival is celebrated in the memory of Shri Ram’s supernatural effort.

The festival is celebrated on the tenth day of the feast day of the month of Ashwin. On this occasion, Durga -puja is done in Bengal, then all of North India May Shri Ram. According to a Pournic story, Devgan went to the shelter of Mahadev Shankar after suffering from the atrocities of a demon named Mahishasura. Shankar’s treachery led to the emergence of a power which all the gods bestowed on them. That power fought fiercely with the monster till day no and conquered it on the tenth day. Since then, this festival is still celebrated every year in the memory of Goddess Durga.

On this very holy date, Sri Ram defeated Lankapani Ravana and liberated Sita from bondage. Shri Ram’s victory over Ravana symbolizes the victory of humanity over demonetisation, truth on untruth and religion over iniquity. In ancient times there were not so many modes of transport, so the journey stopped in the rainy season. By the time of the arrival of Dussehra, the rain is almost over. Therefore, he used to start the yatras by observing this day as auspicious.

There are many ways to celebrate Vijayadashami – National people worship their weapons and scriptures on this day. This day is also considered auspicious for marital functions etc. Gujarati people perform deva-pujan with Garba dance etc. on this day. In Bengal, this festival is celebrated as Durga – Puja in May. Is immersed till no day (in Navratras). A huge Dussehra fair is organized in Himachal Pradesh in May Kullu where people come from every corner of the country. In South India, the Shami tree is worshiped and its leaves are considered as heaven.

Ramlila is organized in most parts of North India, a few days before Dussehra, in which the life-character of Maryada Purshottam Shri Ram is presented. On the day of Dussehra, a huge field of effigy effigies of May Ravana, Medhanath and Kumbhakaran are made, which are filled like fireworks. Peeps of the characters of Ramayana are extracted. When the tableau reaches that vast plain, Rama shows the battle of Ravana. A large crowd gathers to enjoy this festival. In the evening, Shri Ram sets fire to the effigies, and the effigies burn with the sound of explosions.

The festival of Dussehra is a confluence of purity and power that is celebrated as a symbol of the defeat of divine power. This festival gives us the message of victory of virtue over sin and tells that it is human duty to fight against the oppressor, so we should be brave and courageous. We should also try to imbibe the ideals of Shri Ram’s holy character in our lives.

On the day of Vijayadashami we should pledge that we will put our lives at stake to crush the head of the oppressor by forgetting mutual issues and discrimination to protect the integrity, unity and society of the country. We should destroy Saturi mountains in our mind and develop Satvik mountains and take a determination to establish justice, religion and Ramraj in our country.
